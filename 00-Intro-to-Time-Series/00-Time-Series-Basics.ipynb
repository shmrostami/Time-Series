    "# Time Series Basics\n",
    "According to <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series'>wikipedia</a>, a time series is \"a series of data points indexed in time order.\" The goal of time series analysis is to predict future values based on past behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "This differs from other analyses that compare $x$ to $y$, since $x$ is not really a variable. For example, if I measure the boiling point of water with 1%, 3%, 5% and 7% salt solutions, I should be able to predict the boiling point at 4%. But with time series, we can't go back and \"plug in\" a new value of $x$, since we can never go back in time. For this reason, a time series with one $y$ variable is called <em>univariate</em>. "

    "## What are \"endog\" and \"exog\"?\n",
    "The data seen in a time series is described as either <em>endogenous</em>, that is, caused by factors within the system, or <em>exogenous</em>, caused by factors outside the system. We'll see that many statsmodels tools use <tt>endog</tt> to represent the incoming time series data in place of the constant <tt>y</tt>.<br>\n",
